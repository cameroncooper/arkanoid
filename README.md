# Arkanoid

Here is my first release of Arkanoid for the PSP. To play Arkanoid, turn 
your PSP 90 degrees and use the up and down keys to move the paddle back
and forth. To fire a ball use the left trigger. Before you can play, you
must "insert" a coin by pressing the right trigger.

Hope you enjoy it.

Thanks to Nem, ps2dev, Fluff and Koopa.
